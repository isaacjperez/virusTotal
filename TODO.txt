add a way to check how many IPs I am going to run before I run them. The Virus Total API key only allows 500 request per day.
add capability to accept and two pcaps at once.
    extract only the unique and non-private IPs from both and combine them into a single list.
    apply the virus total results to both list.
    maybe make it take up to n files instead of one or two.
    make this step optional in the program.
Review mergeSheets.py
    adding the virus total results to sheet two may be unnecessary.
